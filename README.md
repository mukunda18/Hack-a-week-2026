## 🚀 Overview

**Ghus Meter** is a web-based platform designed to crowdsource data on delays and bribery in public and private sectors. By allowing citizens to anonymously report "ghus" (bribes) paid for services, the project aims to create a map of corruption, helping the public and authorities identify "red zones" where systemic issues persist.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Anonymous Reporting:** Securely report incidents without revealing your identity.
* **Interactive Map:** Visualize which offices or locations have the highest frequency of reports using geospatial data.
* **Real-time Dashboard:** View statistics on total reports, average bribe amounts, and common service delays.
* **Crowdsourced Transparency:** Publicly available data to hold institutions accountable.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Mapping:** Leaflet.js
* **Database:** [Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/) (Serverless Postgres)
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

* **Identity Protection:** No personal identifying information (PII) is collected during the reporting process.
* **Data Integrity:** Reports are stored securely in a relational database, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
